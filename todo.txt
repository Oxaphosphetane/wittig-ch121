- Sn doesn't work with 6-31G** basis set
- pass in Enum instead of enum.value for method and basis
- fix the [O] product entries in all_dfs.json
- bug in rdkit sdf reader [P@TB] nonsense

- molecule.Molecule.infer_bonds_from_coordinates() <- last resort/overkill!

- entry 98 in all_dfs.json has
  [H]C([C@H](OC(C1=CC=CC=C1)=O)[C@@H]([C@@](COC(C2=CC=CC=C2)=O)(OC(C3=CC=CC=C3)=O)[H])OC(C4=CC=CC=C4)=O)=O,
  which is not equal to canonical smiles, used as testing (mol_id = 701)

- change runtime estimator to simple monomial x^p with p \in [2,3]
